# Comprehensive Modular Cybersecurity Framwork (CMCF)

This repository has been created for the research and development of the Comprehensive Modular Cybersecurity Framework (CMCF).
The CMCF is an artifact driven framework for describing and organizing informational artifacts.


Comprehensive 
	in the fact that it looks at risk, operational, and vulnerability information from a recorded artifact

Modular 
	in the fact that you can rip-and-replace based on industry
	
Cybersecurity
	in the fact that it primarily looks to describe cybersecurity
	
Framework
	in the fact that it is a framework for studying and operationalizing cybersecurity information
	
Block-H
	in the fact that it's aligned towards healthcare due to the inclusion of HITURST
	
Conclusion is that the base acronym is 
	CMCF - Comprehensive Modular Cybersecurity Framework
	Block-H Healthcare

Complete String
	CMCF Block-H



This means that you could have 
	CMCF Block-R (Retail)
	CMCF Block-Au (Automotive)
	CMCF Block-A (Aviation)
	CMCF Block-C (Communications)
	
Which means:
	The blocks are based on the ISAC organizations (i.e. automotive isac, avaiation isac, electricity isac, etc.)


List of Possible Blocks

* CMCF Block-AU (Automotive)
* CMCF Block-A (Aviation)
* CMCF Block-C (Communications)
* CMCF Block-DNG (Downstream Natural Gas)
* CMCF Block-EI (Elections Infrastructure)
* CMCF Block-E (Electricity)
* CMCF Block-EMR (Emergency Management and Response)
* CMCF Block-FS (Financial Services)
* CMCF Block-H (Healthcare) >> Proof of Concept MISP Implementation
* CMCF Block-HR (Healthcare Ready)
* CMCF Block-IT (Information Technology)
* CMCF Block-M (Maritime)
* CMCF Block-ME (Media and Entertainment)
* CMCF Block-MS (Multi-State)
* CMCF Block-ND (National Defense)
* CMCF Block-ON (Oil and Natural Gas)
* CMCF Block-R (Realestate)
* CMCF Block-RE (Research and Education)
* CMCF Block-RH (Retail and Hospitality)
* CMCF Block-SPTO (Surface Transporation, Public Transportation, and Over-the-Road Bus)
* CMCF Block-W (Water)

The following artifacts are found within the osrs-event-type MISP taxonomy are under conisderation for research:

* Backdoor
* Botnet
* Campaign
* Data Breach (Non-US)
* Data Breach (US)
* Exploit
* Ransomware
* Security Tool
* Threat Actor
* Tool
* Vulnerability

These events form the basis for domains for which artifacts are collected.
Artifacts are gathered via open online resources.
All copyright information pertaining to the informataion supplied within the collected artifact remains the property of the orginal author.

The frameworks under consideration for evaluation

* HITRUST
* MITRE
* ENISA
* CVE


Goal of the project is to develop a framework that draws bi-directional lines between the following cybersecurity levels:

* Strategic
* Operational
* Tactical
